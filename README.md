# Excel-sales-report
 Created an Excel dashboard to analyze sales data. Extracted useful insights to help improve sales strategies. This project boosted my ability to work with business data and make data-driven decisions. Here are some insights I gathered:

Comparison of Sales and Orders: Used a single chart to compare sales and orders, providing a clear visual representation of trends over time.

Highest Sales and Orders by Month: Identified the month with the highest sales and orders.

Customer Demographics: Analyzed data to find that, in 2022, either men or women made more purchases.

Order Statuses: Listed and analyzed different order statuses for 2022.

Top Contributing States: Identified the top 10 states contributing to sales.

Age and Gender Relationship: Examined the relationship between age and gender based on the number of purchases.

Sales Channels: Determined which sales channel contributed the most to sales.

Highest Selling Category: Found the product category with the highest sales.
